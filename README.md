# gta-re-update-script
Scripts to update my Steam copies of GTA to the RE version and add a desktop shortcut

## Todo

* Make python version
* Move config variable out into a seperate file (ini)
* Add some sort of file or a marker to indicate when the script was last run to avoid aggressively throttling the server.
  * Make the time limit something to like a week
* Backup user saves into a user specified config directory (just in case a build breaks something and user needs to redownload)
